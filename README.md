# WebDevAssessment
Just a little bit of background, I decided to challenge myself and did this entire assignment using Python and Flask which I'm not super familiar with.
I'd say I got about 95% of the asignment done with some parts I would probably need more time to figure out which I will mention below.

----------------------------

website folder contains part I of the assignment
 - Running the main.py file will launch the webserver and the home page can be reached at http://localhost:5000/
 - Navbar mainly only there for looks, home link does work though
 - website is using bootstrap for styles
 - NOTE: so my current solution for validation of the form inputs is not quite 100%
    - After clicking submit the form will run the validations but won't display multiple issues at the same time
    - Also the form will wipe and user will have to reinput their data
 - If I were to do this in Ruby on Rails I would have a model for users that validates all the inputs before the form is submitted and data is processed
 - data isn't stored or anything since the assignment didn't specify that I needed to set up a database for users

----------------------------

writing_code folder contains part II of the assignment
 - query.py has all code and can be ran
 
 ----------------------------
 
reading_code folder contains part III of the assignment
 - sample.py contains all my answers
